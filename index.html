      <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        The Joint Workshop on Linguistics and Language Processing (JWLLP) is an annual workshop that brings together
        researchers from linguistics, NLP, and language technology to examine the relationship between linguistic theory
        and language processing.

        <strong>JWLLP 35 Theme:</strong><br />
        LLM-driven applications in linguistic research, focusing on how large language models can support and be
        informed by theoretical and empirical work in linguistics.
      </div>

      <h2>About the Workshop</h2>
      <p>
        Now in its 35th edition, JWLLP continues its tradition of encouraging interdisciplinary research and linking
        theoretical perspectives with new methodological developments in language research.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 2026 workshop places a special focus on LLM-driven applications in linguistic research, reflecting the rapid
        development of large language models and their expanding influence across subfields of linguistics. As LLMs
        become increasingly relevant to linguistic analysis, language documentation, discourse studies, semantic
        investigation, and multilingual research, this workshop aims to consider how linguistically grounded approaches
        can shape emerging language technologies—and how these technologies, in turn, can contribute to linguistic
        theory and empirical inquiry.
      </p>
